This is a simple example project demonstrating interaction between a TypeScript-b
ased MCP server and Unity. You can build and configure your own tools to expand and develop further.

Create more tools your own!

## TODO List
- Enable Unity to send result messages to MCP
- Change TCP structure (currently implemented with client-server reversed due to a bug in the TypeScript SDK)
  - Unity (Current : TCP Server, TODO : TCP Client)
  - MCP (Current : TCP Client, TODO : TCP Server)
